# Image Recognition
Face recognition on still images using OpenCV in Python.

The program can recognize human faces in still image using data set and show live results. It compares the information with a dataset of known faces to find a match. Facial recognition can help verify personal identity.

## Prerequisites
```
opencv-python
numpy
face_recognition
cmake
dlib
```

## How to run the program
1. Install all the prerequisites using pip3 install package-name.
2. Place a test image with unknown face in the root directory.
3. Place all the faces to be recognized in the /faces folder and name them as name of the person. This will be used to compare the face in the test image and display the name.
